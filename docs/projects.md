# Project companions

Projects save each track's machine by engine, effect and page number, and those
numbers come from the [layout](api.md#identity) of the firmware that saved them.
A **companion** is a small JSON file beside the project, recording what those
numbers meant by machine ID, so firmware with another layout, or another
user's firmware, can open the project with the right machines. Sections let
other firmware features keep their own data in the same file.

Open-XY firmware writes a companion after every project save, listing its
machines; it does not read them yet ([firmware](abi-1.2.1.md#project-companions)).
[`tooling/projects.py`](../tooling/projects.py) is the reference reader and
writer.

## Files

`song.oxy` sits beside `song.xy`, including `workspace.oxy` beside stock's
`/projects/workspace.xy`. Its own extension keeps stock from taking it for a
project. Stock's MTP view shows only the paths it allows, `.xy` but not `.oxy`
under `/projects`, so Open-XY firmware adds `.oxy` beside `.xy` to that view.
Copy both files when you share a project.

Firmware back on stock leaves companions in place, unread and hidden from MTP.
A project saved on stock no longer matches its companion's
[binding](#binding), so returning to Open-XY reads that project's numbers as
saved, as it would without a companion.

## Format

```json
{
  "format": "open-xy-project",
  "project": {
    "bytes": 183204,
    "crc32": "9f1c0a42"
  },
  "sections": {
    "open-xy.machines": {
      "machines": {
        "karplus": {
          "engine": 36,
          "page": 84
        },
        "pingpong": {
          "effect": 40,
          "page": 21
        }
      },
      "profile": "opxy-1.2.1",
      "version": 1
    }
  },
  "version": 1
}
```

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `format` | `open-xy-project` |
| `version` | The envelope's version, 1. Added fields do not change it; a reader ignores a file with a version it does not know |
| `project` | The [binding](#binding) |
| `sections` | Objects by name, each with a positive integer `version` |

A companion is UTF-8 JSON of at most 64 KiB. Readers ignore fields they do not
know. A file that is not valid JSON, has another `format` or a newer `version`,
or has an invalid binding or section, is ignored whole.

### Binding

`bytes` and `crc32` (zlib CRC-32, eight lowercase hex digits) of the `.xy`
file the companion describes. Readers use a companion only when both match the
project's bytes.

### Sections

A section name is `owner.name`, lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, where
the owner is the GitHub user or organisation that defines it; `open-xy` is the
SDK's. A section changes `version` only when an older reader would misread it,
and a reader ignores a section with a version it does not know, using the
rest.

A writer replacing a project rewrites its own sections. It keeps other owners'
sections unchanged while the previous companion still matched the project it
replaces, and drops them otherwise. The firmware writes only `open-xy.machines` for now.

### Canonical form

Writers emit one form: keys sorted, two-space indentation, LF line endings and
a final newline, with no timestamps. The same contents are the same bytes, and
a change diffs as the lines it touched. Readers accept any JSON.

## `open-xy.machines`

Version 1. `profile` is the firmware profile that saved the project, and
`machines` its machines' numbers by ID, in the layout's form: an `engine` and
`page`, or an `effect` and `page`. The firmware lists every machine it holds,
including ones the project does not use; the host writer lists its whole
layout.

A reader with the same profile maps each listed number to that machine's
number in its own layout. A machine missing from its layout is shown as
missing, never replaced by whatever holds its old number. Numbers the section
does not list are read as saved. A section for another profile is ignored.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `python sdk.py project write --layout layout.json <song.xy>...` | Writes each project's companion from the layout of the firmware that saved it, for projects saved before companions |
| `python sdk.py project check <song.xy>...` | Reports whether each project's companion applies to it, and which machines it names |
